# Hydration_app
This is a basic code to implement notifications in your android applications. 
The application reminds the user to hydrate his/her body via a notification every fifteen minutes, by taking water while their device is charging. 

Note better, the notifications are only triggered when the phone is connected to a source of power and it's charging.
